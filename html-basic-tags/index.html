        <h1>Basic Html Tags</h1>
        <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
        <!--
            This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph.
            The paragraph tag belongs to the "block" group of tags.
            A "block" group tag places your content on a new line.

            You can place all your paragraph text content on one physical
                line, however, that would require a lot of scrolling right and left.
            You can have word wrap active in your editor and it will NOT affect
                how the browser displays your paragraph content.
            You can place your content on seperate line yourself and it will NOT
                affect how the browser displays yor paragraph content.
        -->
        <p>The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line when
            the content is displayed by your browser. The browser does not display
            your content in the physical style of how you have entered your code
            in your html file.
        </p>
        <p>This is a second paragraph on the browser page. It will start a new line.
            Did the Go Live update the browser display of my saved changes to the file?
        </p>
        <!--
            If you wish to use a component of a reserved tag (or the whole tag)
                you would be in trouble using the tag
            Instead: you can use special character strings to represent components
                of the tag such as < (&lt;) and the > (&gt; symbols)               
        -->
